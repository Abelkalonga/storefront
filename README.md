Playing around with Jango

Running this project

To get this project up and running you should start by having Python installed on your computer. I advise you create a virtual environment to store the project dependencies separately. You can install virtualenv with

pip install virtualenv

Clone or download this repository and open it in your editor of choice. I use VS Code. 

In a terminal (mac/linux) or windows terminal, run the following command in the base directory of this project

virtualenv env

That will create a new folder env in your project directory. Next activate it with this command on mac/linux:

source env/bin/active

Then install the project dependencies with

pip install -r requirements.txt

Now you can run the project with this command

python manage.py runserver

This is an ongoing project therefore, anyone is welcome to contribute.
